Fast Fourier Transform in fortran

A fast Fourier transform (FFT) is an algorithm that calculates the discrete Fourier transform (frequency components) of some sequence â€“ the discrete Fourier transform transforms the structure of the cycle of a waveform into sine components. A FFT can be used in various types of signal processing. It may be useful in reading things like sound waves, or for any image-processing technologies. A fast Fourier transform can be used to solve various types of equations, or show various types of frequency activity in useful ways.

I found a code online that I'll tweak but first I'm going to select the most important lines of code and explain what they mean.
